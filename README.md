# Brawl-Stars-Leaderboard-Analysis

## What is Brawl Stars?
Brawl Stars is the newest game from the makers of Clash of Clans and Clash Royale, a freemium multiplayer mobile arena fighter/party brawler/shoot 'em up video game developed and published by Supercell.(source:[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brawl_Stars))

## What can we get from the leaderboard data analysis?
I used the [BrawlStats API](https://github.com/SharpBit/brawlstats) to extract the leader board of the Brawl Stars, which contains the global top 200 players data.

By analyzing the trophies, victories and brawler trophies of these top players, we can get some insights of game strategy and best brawlers of the current game version.
